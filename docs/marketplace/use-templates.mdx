   :::

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

Follows these steps to setup your CI/CD pipeline in less than 5 minutes!

1. Select the templates you want in the [Marketplace](https://r2devops.io/marketplace) and append them in the
   `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   include:
      - project: '<project_path>'
         ref: '<version>'
         file: '<template_path>'
      - project: '<project_path>'
         ref: '<version>'
         file: '<template_path>'
     - ...
   ```

2. The templates can be customized üëâ check the [templates
   customization](#-templates-customization) section.

3. Everything is ready! You can now benefit the full power of a CI/CD
   pipeline üéâüöÄ

   :::note
   You can also combine templates and your own jobs in your
   `.gitlab-ci.yml` configuration file.

## ü§ì Pipeline examples

- An example of a full `.gitlab-ci.yml` configuration using templates from the marketplace üëá

  :::info[Templates and jobs used in the example]
  _ Plug-and-play set of templates from the marketplace to automatically build, test
  and deploy static documentation website:
  _ [`mkdocs`](https://r2devops.io/marketplace/gitlab/r2devops/hub/mkdocs) (`latest`
  version)
  _ [`lighthouse`](https://r2devops.io/marketplace/gitlab/r2devops/hub/lighthouse)
  (`latest` version)
  _ [`pages`](https://r2devops.io/marketplace/gitlab/r2devops/hub/pages) (`latest`
  version)
  _ Plug-and-play set of templates from the marketplace to automatically build, push
  and test docker images:
  _ [`docker_build`](https://r2devops.io/marketplace/gitlab/r2devops/hub/docker_build)
  (version `0.3.0`)
  _ [`trivy_image`](https://r2devops.io/marketplace/gitlab/r2devops/hub/trivy_image)
  (version `0.2.0`)
  _ A custom manual job `unit_tests`
  :::

  ```yaml
  stages:
    - build
    - tests
    - provision
    - review
    - release
    - deploy
    - others

  # Templates from r2devops.io (they don't need any configuration in standard cases)
  include:
    - project: 'r2devops/hub'
      ref: 'mkdocs@1.8.1'
      file: 'jobs/mkdocs/mkdocs.yml'
    - project: 'r2devops/hub'
      ref: 'lighthouse@latest'
      file: 'jobs/lighthouse/lighthouse.yml'
    - project: 'r2devops/hub'
      ref: 'pages@latest'
      file: 'jobs/pages/pages.yml'
    - project: 'r2devops/hub'
      ref: 'docker_build@latest'
      file: 'jobs/docker_build/docker_build.yml'
    - project: 'r2devops/hub'
      ref: 'trivy_image@latest'
      file: 'jobs/trivy_image/trivy_image.yml'

  # Locally configured job
  unit_tests:
    image: python:3.9-alpine
    stage: tests
    before_script:
      - pip install pipenv && pipenv --bare install --dev
    script:
      - make test
  ```
## üî¢ Versioning

To retrieve a template version, choose among following syntaxes:

- To have always the latest version use: `@latest`
- You can otherwise precise an exact version: `@<version>` (ex: `@1.2.3`)
- To use the latest version of minor releases with a precise major: `@~<major>` (ex: `@~1`)
- Or the latest version of patch releases with a precise major and minor: `@~<major>.<minor>` (ex: `@~1.2`)

## üîß Templates customization

:::info
All the templates like the ones coming from the `r2devops/hub` specify a docker image to be run in a
docker container.
:::

### üñå Global

Some templates can be customized. To do it, you have to include the template as usual and, in addition, override the options you want to customize.

:::tip
This way, you can override all Gitlab templates parameters. All parameters
are described in [Gitlab
documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/).
:::

For example, if you want to use the [trivy_image](https://r2devops.io/marketplace/gitlab/r2devops/hub/trivy_image) template and
customize it by:

- Redefining the `stage` to `security` to fit in your personal stages workflow,
- Set the variable `TRIVY_VERSION` to `0.9.1` to use this version instead of
  the default,
- Set the variable `TRIVY_SEVERITY` to `CRITICAL` to display only CRITICAL
  issues.

```yaml
include:
  - project: 'r2devops/hub'
    ref: 'trivy_image@1.3.2'
    file: 'jobs/trivy_image/trivy_image.yml'

trivy_image:
  stage: security
  variables:
    TRIVY_VERSION: '0.9.1'
    TRIVY_SEVERITY: 'CRITICAL'
```

### ‚úèÔ∏è Use custom stage

If you want to use your own stage name, it's possible to do so when including
your template. Example:

```yaml
stages:
  - security

include:
  - project: 'r2devops/hub'
    ref: 'trivy_image@1.3.2'
    file: 'jobs/trivy_image/trivy_image.yml'

trivy_image:
  stage: security
```

### üê≥ Advanced: `services`

You may want one of your template to interact with a container instance (API,
database, web server...) to work. GitLab has an option to run a container next
to a template: [`services`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#services).

To use this option, you must have access to an image of the container you want
to run as a service. For example, if you are using our
[docker_build](https://r2devops.io/marketplace/gitlab/r2devops/hub/docker_build) template to build an
image of your application, and you want to test this image using the
[nmap](https://r2devops.io/marketplace/gitlab/r2devops/hub/nmap) template, just add the following configuration in
your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

:::info

- The `name` option must contain your image name and tag, or an image name from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).
- The `alias` option permits to the template to reach your application using a name. This name
  must be the same that the one specified inside the template target's variable.
- You may also run some other services, like a database depending on your application needs.
  :::

```yaml
nmap:
  services:
    - name: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
      alias: app
```

### üé∂ Multiple usage of the same template in your pipeline

If you want to reuse a template from the marketplace, for example launching `apiDoc` to build 2 API documentations in the same pipeline, you can easily do so with the Marketplace's templates using ==extends== GitLab keyword.

```yaml hl_lines="13"
stages:
  - build

include:
  - project: 'r2devops/hub'
    ref: 'apidoc@1.3.2'
    file: 'jobs/apidoc/apidoc.yml'

apidoc:
  variables:
    APIDOC_CONFIG_PATH: src/doc/project1/apidoc.json
    APIDOC_OUTPUT_PATH: website_build/apidoc/project1/

apidoc_project2:
  extends: apidoc
  variables:
    APIDOC_CONFIG_PATH: src/doc/project2/apidoc.json
    APIDOC_OUTPUT_PATH: website_build/apidoc/project2/
```

:::warning
Be aware to have different artifacts path to not overwrite your first artifact by the second one.
