🟡 : access filtered on projects and groups that users can read on GitLab

## 🔑 GitLab Token Configuration

R2Devops uses GitLab tokens to communicate with your GitLab instance:
- To run analysis, it uses the **Access Token** added in `Settings > Organization > Analysis Token`
- To run all other queries, it uses the **OIDC Token** of the currently logged-in user

To create the **Access Token**:
- The token should be a Personal Access Token, ideally linked to a Service Account (not a human)
- If your **R2Devops instance** is connected to an entire **GitLab self-managed instance**
    - If [Admin Mode](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/settings/sign_in_restrictions/#admin-mode) is NOT enabled on your instance
        - Option 1: the token owner must be **Admin** and the token scope must be **`api`**
        - Option 2: the token owner must be **Maintainer** of all root groups and the token scope must be **`api`**
    - If [Admin Mode](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/settings/sign_in_restrictions/#admin-mode) is enabled on your instance
        - Option 1: the token owner must be **Admin** and the token scope must be **`api`** and **`admin_mode`**
        - Option 2: the token owner must be **Maintainer** of all root groups and the token scope must be **`api`**
- If your **R2Devops instance** is connected to a **GitLab group**
    - The token owner must be **Maintainer** of the root group and the token scope must be **`api`**
