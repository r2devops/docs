- **Duration**: 1 year
- **Renewal:** each year, we are doing a retrospective meeting to renew the
  title if relevant for both the Ambassador and R2Devops.

- **Actively promote the brand on social media, blogs, events, etc.**
    - Deliver at least 2 talks or write 2 posts (articles, LinkedIn posts, X

      about CI/CD pipeline security and compliance issues.
    - **Consider recommending R2Devops** as a solution to these challenges,
      provided it aligns with the context.
    - **Connect** engaged decision-makers ready to solve their security
      challenges with R2Devops at least once a year.
- **Support solution implementation in companies.**
    - Implement R2Devops at least once a year in a client project (either
      personally or by assisting colleagues) to ensure your perspective and
      feedback are grounded in real-world client experiences.
