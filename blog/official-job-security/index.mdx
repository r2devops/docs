# Why using R2Devops‚Äô official jobs
You probably already heard about CI/CD. If not, we recommend you to read those two articles about [Continuous Integration](https://go2scale.io/continuous-integration-key-step-of-devopss-process/) and [Continuous Deployment](https://go2scale.io/continuous-deployment-in-devops-process-a-must-have/).

As a reminder, a job is a set of instructions to perform actions on your project. Comining several jobs together is the key to create a powerful pipeline. We will explain to you why you should use R2Devop‚Äôs official jobs. üëáüèº

## Guaranteed security with official jobs

 On r2devops.io, you will find a [library of CI/CD jobs](https://r2devops.io/_/hub), some are officials and some are published by the community. Official jobs are jobs written or reviewed by R2Devops‚Äô technical team. The community ones are personal jobs put online by the community, without examination from us.

All our official jobs go through a strong security pipeline. We made it to ensure tthey are all safe to use in your pipelines!
Here is a schema of our security pipeline, where you can retrieve all the steps:

### Use officials jobs to secure your project

In addition to this pipeline, you can find plenty of jobs in the [hub](https://r2devops.io/_/hub), for a multitude of programming languages. Among the official jobs, you retrieve some of them dedicated to security. You can build strong pipelines for your projects with them!

Other jobs like [gitleaks](https://r2devops.io/_/r2devops-bot/gitleaks) warns you about secrets (passwords, api keys‚Ä¶) you may have pushed in your code.
