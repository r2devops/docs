    style={{ maxWidth: '48%', minWidth: '280px', height: 'auto', borderRadius: '8px' }}
  />

  />
</div>

## 🎯 Targeted Analysis

Run analysis precisely where you need it. Previously, every analysis ran across all your projects and all policies at once.

Now, you can run analysis precisely where you need it:
- **On a specific project**: Instantly check compliance after a configuration change
- **On a specific policy**: Quickly validate a policy update across its targeted projects

This gives you faster feedback and more control over when and what gets analyzed.
