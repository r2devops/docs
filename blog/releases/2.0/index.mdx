**Today, we are excited to announce the release of R2DevOps 2.0! This new
version introduces an enhanced experience for defining supply chain policies, a
brand-new issue dashboard, improved pipeline composition compliance, and much
more!**

## üõ°Ô∏è Policies

<ReleaseLabels licenses={[0, 1, 2]} />

**Policies** are now available in R2Devops. They are the building blocks that
analyze supply chain for compliance and security issues. Each policy focuses on
a specific area and can be customized to align with any organization goals.

The new "Policies" page offers a transparent view of all available policies,
making it easy to view and configure them. Access it from the main navigation
menu to get started.

## üìà Issues dashboard

<ReleaseLabels licenses={[0, 1, 2]} />

Previously, compliance and security issues were scattered across multiple
dashboard tabs. To improve clarity and allow quick identification of issues at
a glance, we‚Äôve introduced the "Issues" page.

This page consolidates all issues identified by policy analyses in one place.
They can be acknowledged to prevent them from appearing again.

## ‚úÖ Pipeline composition compliance

<ReleaseLabels licenses={[2]} />

We‚Äôve enhanced pipeline composition compliance detection. Now, with just a few
clicks, it's possible to specify which CI/CD templates must be used in projects
to ensure compliance.

In addition to verifying template usage, the policy detects forbidden overrides
that may compromise compliance.
