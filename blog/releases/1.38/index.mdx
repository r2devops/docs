## üîç Enhanced CI/CD Compliance

<ReleaseLabels licenses={[2]} selfManagedOnly />

:::info[What is the 'compliance tab'?]
    The compliance tab inside the R2Devops dashboard allows you to check if projects respect a defined compliance policy established by the organization.
:::

We've expanded the compliance policies to include the ability to assign a list of projects to each policy. This allows for different policies to be set for different projects.

:::info[What is the 'Dashboard documentation'?]
    The Dashboard documentation helps you to understand how you can improve CI/CD spotted issues by the analysis.
