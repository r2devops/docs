## üì¶ GitLab CI/CD Catalog Components Compliance

<ReleaseLabels licenses={[1, 2]} />

Ensure pipeline composition compliance with GitLab CI/CD Catalog Components:

Resolve issues faster with improved remediation capabilities:

- Get AI-generated remediation recommendations for complex issues
- Instantly fix issues with one-click remediation when available
