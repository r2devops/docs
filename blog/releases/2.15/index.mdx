## 🎯 Tailored Policies

Now you can create policies that truly match your organization's needs. Design compliance policies focused on what matters most to you and apply them to the right projects.
- **Before**: One universal policy with all controls forced on every project
- **Now**: Create multiple custom policies by selecting specific controls for specific projects

**Ready-to-use policy templates:**
- [ISO 27001 & 27002](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001)
- [OWASP Top 10 CI/CD Risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-ci-cd-security-risks/)
- [🇫🇷 SecNumCloud](https://cyber.gouv.fr/secnumcloud-pour-les-fournisseurs-de-services-cloud)
