# R2Devops 2.4 Release

**We are thrilled to introduce R2Devops 2.4! This release brings a new dashboard access for everyone, improved pipelines images registry resolution and simplified onboarding.**

## üìä Dashboard Access for Everyone

All members of your organization can now access dashboard results. This enables them to monitor the security and compliance status of their pipelines, fostering better adoption of best practices across the entire organization.

Dashboard results are filtered for each members to projects and groups they can access on GitLab.

All R2Devops roles and permissions are described [in the documentation](/docs/use/roles_permissions).

## üîç Improved Pipelines Images Registry Resolution

Previously, when a container image used to run a pipeline job contained a variable, it was resolved only using variables explicitly declared in the CI configuration file. Now, variable resolution also includes the following sources:

- Project variables
- Group variables
- Instance variables
- GitLab predefined variables

## üöÄ Simplified Onboarding

The new onboarding process will guide you through configuring your organization and policies. This makes it easy to set up your instance tailored to your CI/CD security and compliance requirements.
