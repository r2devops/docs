## üîí ISO 27001 Compliance Control

<ReleaseLabels licenses={[2]} />

Get comprehensive **ISO 27001 compliance controls** for **CI/CD pipelines** to help your organization pass **certification** with automated compliance checks against **ISO 27001 requirements**.

## üë• Organization Roles Verification

<ReleaseLabels licenses={[0, 1, 2]} />

To enhance security and maintain proper access control, you can now have control over **organization role quotas verifications**. This feature prevents role sprawl by allowing you to set minimum and maximum limits for each role (**Owner**, **Maintainer**, **Developer**, and **Total members**) within **Access and Authorization** policy.

By enforcing these limits, you can ensure your organization follows the **principle of least privilege**, reducing unnecessary access and improving security.

<ReleaseLabels licenses={[0, 1, 2]} />

The analysis issues interface now offers improved **visibility and control** with:

- Chart showing issue count evolution over time
- Filtering by group/project
- Searching through issue data
