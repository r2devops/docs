## 🔒 ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Compliance Controls

## 👥 Project Member Role Quotas

<ReleaseLabels licenses={[1, 2]} />

To enhance security and maintain proper access control, you can now have control over **organization role quotas verifications**. This feature prevents role sprawl by allowing you to set minimum and maximum limits for each role (**Owner**, **Maintainer**, **Developer**, and **Total members**) within **Access and Authorization** policy.

It reduces risk ([OWASP - CICD-SEC-2](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-ci-cd-security-risks/CICD-SEC-02-Inadequate-Identity-And-Access-Management)) and allows compliance with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 controls 8.2, 8.4, 5.15, and 5.18.

## 📊 Improved Issues Page Experience

<ReleaseLabels licenses={[0, 1, 2]} />

The analysis issues interface now offers improved **visibility and control** with:

- Chart showing issue count evolution over time
- Filtering by group/project
- Searching through issue data
