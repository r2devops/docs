## 🔎 Enhanced CI/CD analysis

- We now fully support a wider range of GitLab CI syntax, including specific
  `environment`, `variables`, and `rules` definitions. This brings more
  accurate analysis
- R2Devops can now detect archived projects
- Jobs coming from nested templates are now fully supported
- Analysis is further enhanced by leveraging GitLab's own include resolution,
  improving precision and compatibility with restricted network environments
- The `include:project` syntax for marketplace templates is now fully
  recognized

## 🫙 Refined Container Identification

Official Docker Hub containers are no longer automatically categorized as
"Official" but instead identified as "Unknown". This change paves the way for
future options to define your own trusted container registries.

## ⚙️ Minor Updates

- Analysis on our SaaS platform (R2Devops.io) is now significantly faster
  thanks to the ability to scale workers up to 150. This means quicker results
  and smoother workflows for you.
- Restore quick update of outdated marketplace templates usage inside the
  `Maintainability > Marketplace templates` tab.
- Improve session auto-refresh in the frontend interface
