## ⚙️ Minor Updates

- **Analysis History**: Monitor and review the complete analysis history.
- **CI/CD Missing**: When the GitLab CI/CD configuration is missing, it is now indicated on the `Issues` and `Details > Pipeline Composition` pages.
- **Global Analysis**: The details pages were previously scoped to a specific analysis; that is no longer the case.
- **Improved Composition Chart Performance**: The chart now loads twice as fast.
