# R2Devops is registered as a GitLab alliance partner

Since February 2022, R2Devops has joined [GitLab technical partnersâ€™ list](https://about.gitlab.com/partners/technology-partners/#continuous-integration)! Itâ€™s a stamp validating our engagement to simplify developers life and improve the solutions for the DevOps community.

## Promote continuous integration and ease CI/CD onboarding

Continuous integration and Continuous Deployment are one of many cornerstones of DevOps processes. In GitLab, jobs are the resources used in your .gitlab-ci.yml file allowing you to **check continuously your code** and push it to your users as soon as itâ€™s validated.

But creating those jobs requires a lot of time, as well as maintaining them. Not to mention the competences needed in your team to implement the first pipeline. Using R2Devops, you will **access official jobs and jobs developed by the community** to build easily your pipelines. 

Furthermore, in order to simplify the collaboration with GitLab, we developed a new version of R2Devops, in which you can **link your own GitLab's jobs**. Now you can **share them with anyone without effort**, and enjoy all the features of R2Devops. Among them, your documentation will now be build automatically from the data of your README file.

##  Shared values between partners: the power of open source

As GitLab, **we promote transparency, efficiency and collaboration**. These are the 3 essential values to build an open source project. ðŸ’ª 

But itâ€™s not only the project that is **open source**: our mindset follows the same road. We promote these values in every step of our work!

The joint alignment of our values is the confirmation of our mutual goal: **make CI/CD a must-have for every tech company, and revolutionize the way projects are developed**. 

### Whatâ€™s next

We plan on conquering the world and see R2Devops in every GitLabâ€™s pipelines. But first, we want to extend our jobsâ€™ library in order to support every developer in its CI/CD tasks. **If you want to build the open source CI/CD of tomorrow, join us on [Discord](https://discord.r2devops.io?utm_medium=website&utm_source=r2devopsblog&utm_campaign=partnergitlab)!**
