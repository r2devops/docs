## Why we created R2Devops?

One of the biggest CI/CD challenges for companies is that CI/CD is not reusable, not maintained, not observable.

[R2Devops](https://r2devops.io) solves this problem by providing ready-to-use CI/CD templates following a quality standard (control, security) and can be easily reused.
